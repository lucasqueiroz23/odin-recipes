    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). 
        Grease and flour two 9-inch round cake pans.
      </li>
      <li>
        Beat sugar, butter, and dry strawberry gelatin together in a large bowl with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. 
        Add eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition.
      </li>
      <li>
        Combine flour and baking powder in a large bowl; stir into butter mixture alternately with milk.
        Blend in strawberry puree and vanilla. 
        Divide batter evenly between the prepared pans.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 25 to 30 minutes. 
        Cool cakes on a wire rack for 10 minutes; run a table knife around the edges to loosen. 
        Invert carefully onto a serving plate or cooling rack to cool completely.
      </li>
    </ol>
